# Introduction

Insects and pests are a trouble for people who garden and farm. Some of them could destroy entire gardens and fields if left alone. To efficiently remove insects and pests, the first step is to identify them. But identifying them manually is not an easy task for a person who is not an entomologist (A scientist who studies insects) or doesnt have prior knowledge about bugs, as there are around [900,000 species of insects in the world](https://www.si.edu/spotlight/buginfo/bugnos) (80% of world's species). The project is aimed to assist farmers, gardeners, bug enthusiasts and nature lovers who want to find the ID of a bug.

In the project, Django will be used for creating the frontend and backend. The user will have an interface with an option to upload an image. Once the image is uploaded, the image classifier will give a prediction of the insect's name along with the accuracy of the prediction. Details about the insect's favorite plants and ways to repel the insect's will also be displayed to the user.
